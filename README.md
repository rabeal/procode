# procode

This repository contains the source code for ProCode, a web app (http://www.procode.run) that rates the quality of source code.  ProCode was a data science project created for the Insight Data Science Fellows Program (http://insightdatascience.com/, Fall 2015).

In the presentation folder, you will find a pdf with more information on the project.

The files at app/, static/, and templates/ are the web app part of ProCode.

The sourcestyle/ folder contains the heart of the ProCode functionality, including the program syntax analysis, feature extraction, and classification.  

The data in app/output was used to train/test the classifier.
